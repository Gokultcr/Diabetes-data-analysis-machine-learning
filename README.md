# Diabetes-data-analysis-machine-learning

Here basic data analysis and different machine-learning algorithms are applied over diabetes data set.
The dataset consists of 768 rows (patients), with 9 features. Which includes:
* Pregnancies
* Glucose
* BloodPressure
* SkinThickness
* Insulin
* BMI
* DiabetesPedigreeFunction
* Age
* Outcome (Outcome 0 means No diabetes, 1 means diabetes)

# Python Libraries
* numpy
* pandas
* matplotlib
* seaborn
* sklearn

# Machine-Learning Algorithms
* Logistic Regression
* k-Nearest Neighbors
* Decision Tree
* Random Forest
* Gradient Boost
* Support Vector Machine
* Gaussian Naive Bayes
* Neural Networks


# Summary

Here the diabetes data set analysed and different types of machine learning models for classification and regressions are applied. For the better results parameters are tuned and applied methods for reducing overfiting.
